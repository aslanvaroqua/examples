/*Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die. Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing booleans), return if a given number of new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule
