Write a program that answers YES/NO search queries containing * placeholders. Example: if the data you have is (hazem, ahmed, moustafa, fizo), then you should answer as follows for: 
 ahmed: YES 
 m**stafa: YES 
 fizoo: NO 
 fizd: NO 
 *****: YES 
 ****: YES  
**: NO 
 Your program should be able to answer each search query in O(1).
