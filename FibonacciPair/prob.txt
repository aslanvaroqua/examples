Assume we only take the least significant digit of each value in fibonacci sequence, and form the sequence of digits into pairs. In those pairs, the first value of one pair is the same as second value of its predecessor.

As we know the fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
so the pair sequence is:
[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 8], [8, 3], [3, 1] ...

Write a function to output the first n pairs of this sequence.
void Outputpairs(int n)
